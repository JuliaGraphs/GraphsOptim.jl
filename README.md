A package for graph optimization algorithms that rely on mathematical programming.

## Getting started

This package is still experimental, which is why it is not yet registered.
To install it, you need to use the GitHub URL:

```julia
using Pkg; Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphsOptim.jl")
```

## Roadmap

This package only contains a few algorithms, and we would like to add more.
New contributors are always welcome: just pick a problem from [our roadmap issue](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphsOptim.jl/issues/14), open a pull request following the [guidelines](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphsOptim.jl/CONTRIBUTING.md), and we will help you get it merged!
